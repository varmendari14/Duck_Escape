there seems to be an issue with the GameWon Scenario. Wherever in the game it checks if all the ducks are caught, normally it would have
made a reference to a GameEnding object (at least thats what it does for the loss scenario which I was able to find and fix). For example,
in the loss scenario there is a script attached to the timer called TimerCountdown with a public GameEnding object. This is what we need
to fix but for the gameWon.

I don't know where the reference is set since one of yall made it but I was able to resolve the issue for losing so I assume it's the same
if we can locate that.

Right now, you cannot pick up the last duck and it will just teleport away if you try to. The issue appeared at the same time as the loss
scenario i mentioned so i assume its the same problem. I can't fix this myself without knowing where
the game checks for the final duck pickup and calls GameEnding.gameWon(). If you know where it is you can fix this, it shouldnt be hard.
just drag GameEndingHandler into the public GameEnding and it (hopefully) should be good to go.
